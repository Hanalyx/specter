# Changelog

All notable changes to Specter will be documented in this file.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-03

### Added

- `specter.yaml` project manifest — defines system metadata, domain grouping, coverage thresholds, and spec registry
- `specter init` command — scaffolds specter.yaml from existing specs with `--name` and `--force` flags
- Domain grouping — group specs by business area (payments, auth, content) with tier inheritance
- Tier cascade — spec tier → domain tier → system tier → default (2)
- Configurable coverage thresholds per tier via manifest `settings.coverage`
- Auto-maintained spec registry rebuilt on every sync run
- Domain-level coverage aggregation
- `spec-manifest.spec.yaml` — the manifest's own spec (10 constraints, 14 ACs)
- 104 tests (up from 85), 7 specs (up from 6)

## [0.2.4] - 2026-04-03

### Fixed

- Route-path ID now takes priority over generic-filename logic for Next.js App Router files (`onboarding-route` → `onboarding`, `slug-route` → `blog-slug`)
- Zod `.min(N, "message")` and `.max(N, "message")` with custom error messages now extracted correctly (previously the closing paren regex failed when extra args were present)
- Zod `.email("message")` and `.url("message")` with custom messages now extracted correctly
- CLI discovers `prisma/schema.prisma` from parent directories when scanning a subdirectory like `src/`

### Added

- `--exclude` flag for `specter reverse` — exclude paths from scanning (e.g., `--exclude src/components --exclude "*.test.*"`)

## [0.2.3] - 2026-04-03

### Fixed

- Strip inline Python comments before constraint extraction — eliminates false positives from `# isort:skip`, `# noqa`, etc. on import lines (Django: 67 → 31 constraints, 36 false positives removed)

## [0.2.2] - 2026-04-03

### Fixed

- P0: Map unknown `validation.rule` values to `"custom"` — Specter no longer rejects its own output for Go struct tags (`gte`, `lte`, `oneof`), Python Field kwargs (`min_length`, `max_length`), or Prisma attrs (`unique`)
- P1: Add `.spec.tsx`, `.spec.jsx`, `.spec.js` to TypeScript test file detection — previously 713 test assertions silently lost in refine
- P1: Fix test description truncation on embedded quotes — `it("'visible' value")` no longer stops at the first `'`
- P1: Filter Python comment directives (`# isort`, `# noqa`, `# type:`, `# pragma`) from constraint extraction
- P2: Incorporate parent directory into spec ID for generic filenames (`index.ts` → `auth-index`, `main.go` → `rest-main`, `route.ts` → `users-route`)

### Added

- `normalizeValidationRule()` in core engine with alias mapping (gte→min, lte→max, oneof→enum, etc.)
- Generic filename detection list for spec ID collision prevention
- Improvement roadmap document (`docs/IMPROVEMENT_ROADMAP.md`)
- Updated CLAUDE.md with mission statement, design principle, and bug priority framework

## [0.2.1] - 2026-04-03

### Fixed

- Fix null `validation.value` crash when Zod patterns have no extractable literal (`.email()`, `.url()`, `.optional()`, `.refine()`, `z.boolean()`, `z.array()`)
- Fix all Next.js App Router files generating the same spec ID `route` — now derives ID from route path (e.g., `/api/webhooks/stripe` → `webhooks-stripe`)
- Include source file path in `validation_failed` diagnostics for easier debugging
- Find `package.json`/`go.mod`/`pyproject.toml` in parent directories for system name inference

### Added

- TypeScript adapter: extract constraints from TypeScript enums, union types, and `as const` arrays
- TypeScript adapter: extract constraints from Prisma schema files (`.prisma`) — field types, `@unique`, `@db.VarChar(N)`, required/optional
- TypeScript adapter: extract role and status constraints from code patterns (e.g., `session.user.role === "ADMIN"`)
- TypeScript adapter: recognize `.url()`, `z.boolean()`, `z.array()` Zod patterns
- Zod enum now extracts values (e.g., `z.enum(["a", "b"])` → `Value: "a", "b"`)
- 85 tests (up from 77)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-03

### Added

- `specter reverse` command — reverse compiler extracts draft .spec.yaml from existing code
- Plugin adapter architecture with 3 built-in adapters: TypeScript, Python, Go
- TypeScript adapter: Zod schemas, Jest/Vitest tests, Next.js/Express routes
- Python adapter: Pydantic models, pytest tests, FastAPI/Django routes
- Go adapter: struct validate tags, table-driven tests, net/http/gin/chi routes
- Gap detection: flags constraints without test coverage
- Auto-detection of language adapter from file extensions
- spec-reverse.spec.yaml (10 constraints, 14 ACs)
- 77 total tests (up from 37)

## [0.1.0-alpha.2] - 2026-04-02

### Changed

- Migrated from TypeScript/Node.js to Go (single static binary, zero runtime dependencies)
- All 5 MVP tools rewritten: parse, resolve, check, coverage, sync
- Cross-platform binary distribution via goreleaser (linux, darwin, windows)
- DEB package available for Debian/Ubuntu

### Added

- GitHub Actions release workflow (tag-triggered)
- Community files: issue templates, PR template, CODEOWNERS
- CHANGELOG.md

## [0.1.0-alpha.1] - 2026-03-28

### Added

- Initial TypeScript implementation of Specter
- MVP tools: parse, resolve, check, coverage, sync
- Canonical spec schema (JSON Schema draft 2020-12)
- Dogfooding: Specter validates its own specs
