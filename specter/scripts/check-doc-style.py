"""Hanalyx documentation style check (language-neutral: runs anywhere python3 is present).

Enforces the prohibited list from the developer documentation style guide (canonical copy:
Context Plane dev/DEVELOPER_DOCUMENTATION_STYLE_GUIDE):

  1. Em dashes (the U+2014 character).            markdown prose             per line
  2. AI-speak filler and hype words and phrases.  markdown prose + comments  per line
  3. Emojis / decorative pictographs.             markdown AND .yml/.yaml/.json
  4. British spellings (US English rule).         markdown prose + comments  per line
  5. Reading level above the gate.                markdown prose             per FILE

Document class (v5). The guide scopes itself: founding and strategy documents (mission, vision,
roadmap) and marketing copy are "out of scope (formatting)" while remaining "bound by the trust
and clarity principles". So rules 1 and 3, which are punctuation and decoration, do not apply to
those documents. Rules 2, 4 and 5 do, because voice and clarity are exactly what the guide keeps
in scope. See formatting_exempt().

v4 reconciles three independently written v3 implementations (kensa, openwatch, website), which
shared a version number and nothing else. What each contributed, and why v4 is not just one of
them: openwatch scanned CODE COMMENTS, which the guide requires and the other two lacked. kensa
documented the ratcheting exemption ledger and set its gate by measuring its own corpus. This
implementation had the only spelling table free of false positives. All three flagged at least
one correct US spelling, which is worse than missing a British one, because it teaches writers
to ignore the check.

The finding label is "us-english". kensa called it "us-spelling" and openwatch called it
"british"; anything grepping for those needs updating.

Scope (HP-008). Em dashes, AI-speak and US English are prose rules and run on Markdown only. The
emoji rule is not a prose rule, so it also runs on structured files (.yml, .yaml, .json), where
emoji in issue templates and workflows are otherwise invisible to the gate.

Matching (HP-003).
- Single always-hype words match their inflected forms (leverage / leverages / leveraging /
  streamlined), so the common half of AI speak no longer escapes the check.
- Words that also have a legitimate technical sense (harness, unlock, elevate, delve, embark)
  are matched only inside their hype phrase, never as a bare word, so "test harness",
  "unlock_time", and "elevated privileges" are not flagged.
- Fenced code blocks and inline `code` spans in Markdown are exempt (code is not prose).
- A line with `<!-- doc-style: allow -->` is skipped when a maintainer has cleared the term.

US English (v3). An explicit British-to-US table, never a blanket "-ise to -ize" rule: advise,
surprise, exercise and comprise are correct US spellings and a suffix rule would flag all of
them. Inline code, fenced blocks, URLs and Markdown link targets are stripped before matching,
so an identifier, a third-party URL, or a proper noun inside a link never trips the check. Keep
a British spelling inside a quotation, a proper noun, or a standard's own title with the
per-line allow escape.

Reading level (v3). Flesch-Kincaid grade, computed per file over prose only. Headings, tables,
fenced and inline code, link targets, HTML comments and front matter are removed first, so terms
of art and command names never raise the grade: the target constrains sentence construction, not
vocabulary. Files with fewer than MIN_SENTENCES scored sentences are skipped, because the metric
is unstable on short files. The writing target is grade 10. The GATE sits above the target,
because prose can be dense without being unclear, and it is set from a measurement of this
repo's own corpus (see --grades).

Usage:
  python3 scripts/check-doc-style.py <file> [more ...]   # check specific files
  python3 scripts/check-doc-style.py --changed           # files changed vs origin/main

# The writing TARGET from the style guide. Not the gate: it is what an author aims at.
READING_TARGET = 10.0
# The failing gate, set by measuring this repo's corpus (--grades) rather than picked to be safe.
# A gate no file exceeds proves only that the check ran.
#
# Re-derived for v6, because the v5 measurement was biased: a bullet block counted as one long
# sentence, so list-heavy documents read denser than they are (bugs/HP-OW-018 defect 3). Corrected
# distribution over 87 scored files: median 9.4, p75 10.4, p90 11.5, max 14.9. The v5 numbers were
# median 9.8 and max 15.2 over 77 files; ten more files now score, because splitting bullet blocks
# pushes them past the MIN_SENTENCES floor.
#
# Derived for Specter on 2026-08-09 under v6, over its own corpus. Do not carry a gate across
# repos: the website numbers this comment used to hold (median 9.4, p90 11.5, max 14.9, gate 12.5)
# describe a different corpus, and 12.5 fails nothing here.
#
# Specter, 25 scored files: median 8.7, p90 about 10.5, max 11.4, min 6.3.
#
# 11.0 fails 1 file (docs/ssrb/SSRB-099.md at 11.4). 10.5 would fail 4 and 10.0 would fail 6.
# Picked 11.0: it sits above the grade 10 writing target, as the style guide intends, and it still
# bites, which 12.5 did not. Tighten toward 10.0 as the SSRB briefs are rewritten. The gate may
# only ever move down.
READING_GATE = 11.0
# Below this many scored sentences, Flesch-Kincaid is noise. The guide sets the floor at 25.

# Per-file reading-level exemptions. This is a RATCHETING LEDGER: entries may be removed by
# rewriting the prose, never added to raise the gate, and never given a value above the grade the
# file scored when it was added. Each needs a reason.
READING_EXEMPT = {
    # path: (max_grade, reason)
    # Empty by design. Adoption step 2 says start empty, and Specter has no file that needs an
    # entry: the whole corpus already sits under the 11.0 gate except one SSRB brief, and that
    # one should be rewritten rather than exempted. The website entry that shipped with this file
    # was removed on adoption; it named a document Specter does not have.

    added roughly 31 grades. Documents heavy in lists then read far denser than they are, the gate
    gets raised to accommodate them, and real long-sentence prose slips under it. Measured on
    openwatch's CONTRIBUTING.md: 14.7 as shipped, 10.1 list-aware, on a file already at the target
    (bugs/HP-OW-018 defect 3).

    Terminating every unpunctuated line instead is the opposite error, and openwatch measured that
    one too: an 80-column wrapped sentence becomes three, and a whole corpus reads about two grades
